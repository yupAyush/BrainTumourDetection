# Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN

## Overview
This project implements a **deep learning-based multi-class classification model** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. The model determines:
- **If a tumor is present**
- **The specific type of tumor**

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is sourced from **Kaggle**. It contains labeled MRI images for various brain tumor types.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow** / Keras


- **Matplotlib** (For Visualization)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (For Data Handling)
- **Streamlit** (For Deployment)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yupAyush/BrainTumourDetection
cd BrainTumourDetection
